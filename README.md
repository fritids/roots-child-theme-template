roots-child-theme-template
==========================

A child theme template for the roots WordPress theme :: http://www.rootstheme.com/
Keep the roots theme untouched and customize as you see fit.

Things to note :: 

• This child theme assumes that the roots theme is in a folder called 'roots' (in the Wordpress themes folder, of course)
• Change the name of the folder to whatever you want the child theme to be called
• Activate the roots theme first, then activate the child.
• I always like to create a custom menu. (I've found that the roots generated menu is never what I want.)
• Add custom functions to functions.php and add custom styles to style.css
